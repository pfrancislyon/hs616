What are my impressions of day one for HS616 Statistical Computing for Biomedical Data?
1)	I should have done the exercises and reading before class 1
2)	The excitement of the professor about the subject is so high, that Iâ€™m feeling guilty about not doing the pre-work
3)	My beloved laptop is not friendly, nor does it talk to the USF internet in the classroom
4)	This looks like fun, so I need to get into it
5)	I should have bought the book earlier
6)	R we having fun yet?
7)	All of the above.
